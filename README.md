## About the Book
The Web evolves very quickly. Technologies come and go, and every couple of years, new
ideas emerge and become widely popular, only to be replaced by something else after a
while.
Aurelia is such a modern framework. The brainchild of Rob Eisenberg, the father of
Durandal, it is based on cutting edge Web standards, and is built on modern software
architecture concepts and ideas, to offer a powerful toolset and an awesome developer
experience.
